<h3 align="center"> How It Works  </h3>
 
The YouTube Skip Ads Python application utilizes advanced techniques to automatically detect and skip advertisements while watching YouTube videos. Here's how it works:<br>

1. **Detection**: The program continuously analyzes the video frames for the presence of ad images or logos commonly associated with skip ads. It intelligently identifies these visual cues within the video.<br>

2. **Skip Trigger**: Once an ad image or logo is detected, the program waits for a mouse movement event. This allows you to have full control over skipping ads without any false positives. It ensures that the video is not unintentionally skipped.<br>

3. **Skip Action**: When you move the mouse, the program recognizes this action as your intention to skip the ad. As a result, the program immediately skips the ad and resumes playing the actual video content, providing you with an uninterrupted viewing experience.<br>

By combining advanced image detection algorithms with user-triggered actions, the YouTube Skip Ads Python application simplifies the process of skipping ads on any YouTube video with ads. You can enjoy your videos without the hassle of manually navigating through advertisements.
